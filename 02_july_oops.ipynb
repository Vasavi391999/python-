In python, protected members and methods are declared using single underscore(‘_’) as prefix before their names.If the class member declared as public then it can be accessed everywhere. If the class members declared as protected then it can be accessed only within the class itself and by inheriting child classes. If the class members declared as private then it may only be accessed by the class that defines the member"
